					<description><![CDATA[Amazing photos and descriptions!  Feels like I&#039;m following Paul Theroux or Kerouac.  Keep it coming :).  Great pic of you both looking stunned at the bus stop:  ok~ now that you&#039;re seasoned...give em hell next time!  The photos of the skewers and the cocktails makes me want to bail out and go eat and drink.  xxoo]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So happy to see your blog update today :)  Well we all knew there would be at least one scam and I&#039;m glad it all worked out in the end.  The floating lantern festival came just at the right time.  Loving all your photos and stories.  We all miss you guys very much, but are so glad your adventure is all you had hoped it would be.  Be safe and happy trails!  Love you two!]]></description>
