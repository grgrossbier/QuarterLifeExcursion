					<description><![CDATA[Ouch :(    So sorry to hear about the accommodations...  Sounds ghastly.  The only saving grace is that you&#039;re able to move on while they&#039;re still there... listening to an endless loop of Christmas music.

Shots of the caves are epic.  Can&#039;t even imagine what it&#039;d be like to take that all in.  

I could get happily lost on that scooter on the country road with those cows wandering along.

So grateful for your updates!]]></description>
