								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Khao Sok is bordering one of two entrances into the national park. Think pythons, gibbons, and leeches kind of wilderness. Now we were in the true jungle.  </p>
<p>We stayed in a bungalow that came equipped with its own frog to nab all of the bugs&#8230;score! We were told there was a ceremony going on at the monkey temple down the street so we decided to check it out. No monkeys were seen, but we did meet some nice locals that ushered us into the festival, almost involuntarily,  and they gave us a strange, slimy white (fruit?) dish that was sweet and not unpleasant. We communicated via gestures and figured out the festival was honoring Buddha, we think. </p>
<p>We wandered on at this point and found a series of rickety stairs and ladder combination that led up the shear cliff of a mountain. We had to see what was at the top. After seven different levels, we climbed up to the mouth of a cave, and as the sun was setting at this point, bats were chattering and flying around the opening. It was a great find. Two feral dogs escorted us back to our bungalows as we wandered back through the jungle.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515190.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515190.jpg" id="blogsy-1450698935159.616" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="281"></a></div>
<p>The next day we decided to trek into the jungle on the Tan Sawan waterfall hike. The first few km were along a service road. Then, it was jungle trail for the rest of the trek. We were weaving around a trail that loosely followed the river. Up and down we went for miles. Every so often, there was a beach access point or waterfall that we could hike to from the main trail. There was some gorgeous landscape to see. On one such beach, I was eating lunch and noticed blood coming through my pant leg. Crap, what was that from? I lifted my pants up and two fat leeches were happily sucking away at me. I yelled at Grant to come over and pry it off me while simultaneously trying to flick off another one that was cruising up my shoe. I thought leeches lived in water, what the hell was this? My California creature knowledge didn&#39;t cover this possibility. We got them off, did a quick body check, and got the hell out of there. Later, we decided to tuck our pants into our socks to ward off any others. Good luck to the tourists we saw with sandals and shorts on. </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515250.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515250.jpg" id="blogsy-1450698935141.037" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="270" height="480"></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515292.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515292.jpg" id="blogsy-1450698935072.836" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="270" height="480"></a></div>
<p>The views were worth the 10 or so leech bites we gathered. We heard birds and insects chattering away the whole time we were there. At one point we came across a flock of hornbills that were noisily following one another. It was an awesome hike. At the end of the day Grants phone read 14 miles total, and all our clothes were soaked in sweat. On top of all of this, and probably the most important part (Grant typing now), we found a Packer fan! What a spectacular day!</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515450.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515450.jpg" id="blogsy-1450698935164.068" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="270" height="480"></a></div>
<p>The following day we were off to the other entrance of the Khao Sok national park at Chiao Lan reservoir. </p>
<p>We woke up early and headed out to Chiao Lan. The long tail ride from the main pier out to our floating bungalow was amazing. Sheer faces of limestone and sandstone shot out of the reservoir at random. We drove by many islands made of rock and dense jungle vegetation. </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515497.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515497.jpg" id="blogsy-1450698935159.3948" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="281"></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515540.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515540.jpg" id="blogsy-1450698935137.005" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="270" height="480"></a></div>
<p>The area was dammed in the 1980s and is now referred to as the largest ecological disaster in Thailand&#39;s history. The reservoir filled up with 6 months. Because it filled up so quickly, a large number of animals were displaced or trapped on islands. A conservationist attempted to save the trapped animals, but the combination of stress and limited resources in the relocation areas caused the majority to die. He ended up killing himself due to the failure of this project. </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515588.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515588.jpg" id="blogsy-1450698935083.904" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="202"></a></div>
<p>Regardless, it was a beautiful area. About 20 minutes into our boat ride it started POURING. We were soaked within a minute or so. I looked back at our longboat driver who was under a protective canopy and he laughed and waved at our situation. &#8220;Good luck!&#8221; he yelled. Another crew member walked up and collected all our valuables to put into a dry bag he had on hand. &#8220;No rain until today!&#8221; he said while laughing. I&#39;m glad someone was amused. Soaking wet and cold (the first time in two weeks!) we arrived at our bungalows. The lake water was warmer than the air at this point so we hung our clothes, changed into bathing suits and hopped in the water. </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515635.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515635.jpg" id="blogsy-1450698935144.882" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="281"></a></div>
<p>After, we did a short jungle trek with multiple river crossings (up to my neck!). Our guide Guy (or &#8220;chicken&#8221;, as some tourists call him) was a very pleasant Thai man who did this trek daily. He knew all about the surrounding land and stopped a few times to scope out noises only he could hear. We were led to <span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">a cave that was incredible. </span>There we saw spiders as big as our hands and tons of bats. My favorite memory of the giant cave spider was watching one prance away after we knocked the stick he was on. It was out of a cartoon, and any fear I had at the time slipped away.</p>
<p>We then cruised back to our bungalow for some beer drinking and lake floating for the rest of the evening. </p>
<p>The next day we explored for gibbons and dusky langurs (a type of monkey with a long tail). The trick to spotting them is to look for abnormal branch rustling amongst the trees. We ended up seeing many of both species. </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515688.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Photo-20151221185515688.jpg" id="blogsy-1450698935087.2039" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="281"></a></div>
<p>After all of this, it was time to depart. The long tail boat ride out was gorgeous, and dry thankfully. We made it back to our bus, and when we were back in town celebrated the trip with two large coconut shakes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Khao Lak was a quaint little town that reminds me of Santa Barbara. It&#8217;s mid-sized and friendly, twenty minutes from the mountains, and 5 minutes to the water. We hiked, we swam, we celebrated, and we ate. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Our adventure to get to Khao Lak (from Ko Samui) was another story. To start (at 530am), the trip consisted of a mini-bus, a bus, a ferry, a bus, a van, a scam, a van, and a bus. The whole time we were being told where to go, with little confidence in where we were going. We just kept repeating &#8220;Khao Lak&#8221; and people just kept nodding their heads. At one point (the scam), we were dumped at a crappy little travel shack in Surat Thani (a crappy town) and told to wait for the bus. Suddenly, apparently the bus wasn&#8217;t coming. They were busy with the full moon party, and if we want to get to Khao Lak, we need to pay 3500 B for a taxi or take another bus in 5 hours to a stop 2 hours short of Khao Lak, and take a 2000 B taxi. Of course this was all explained in fractured English so all we could do was grin and nod.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpid-Photo-20151201185736487.jpg" target="_blank"><img id="blogsy-1448971109167.4556" class="aligncenter" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpid-Photo-20151201185736487.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="480" /></a></div>
<p>This all smelled fishy to start but we didn&#8217;t know what to do. We continued pressing our point that we already paid for a full and complete trip, and eventually elected for the cheaper bus. When the woman immediately offered to lower the cost of the taxi option, we knew she was screwing us. After she wandered away with our bus receipt (that we luckily took a picture of), we called the hostel we booked though and they confirmed our suspicion. While Grant was on the phone and strangly simoultaneously, it seemed the real van escourt that was suppose to take us to the bus station appeared. Four hours later we found ourselves in Khao Lak, dumped at the foot of our hostel, stoked to be done traveling for a few days.</p>
<p>Khao Lak, unlike the bus, was awesome.</p>
<p>We stumbled into the town during the floating lantern festival. The festival lets people release their bad thoughts, omens and demons and float them down the river. At the same time it is a celebration of life and the elements that fuel our existence. Of course we joined in and released our bad thoughts. Easy as that.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpid-Photo-20151201185736535.jpg" target="_blank"><img id="blogsy-1448971109161.3118" class="aligncenter" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpid-Photo-20151201185736535.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="480" /></a></div>
<p>On top of the traditional aspects, the food was extra good and cheap: $0.30 for a pork skewer, $1.00 for the best fried chicken I&#8217;ve ever had (sorry Mom), and $0.50 for a coconut shake. Dinner done.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpid-Photo-20151201185736579.jpg" target="_blank"><img id="blogsy-1448971109171.022" class="aligncenter" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpid-Photo-20151201185736579.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="480" /></a></div>
<p>We got around on scooter in Khao Lak and did it more successfully this time. With our new found power, we covered miles (kilometers) with ease.</p>
<p>The first thing we did was hike because it had been too long. Our first hike was a five tier waterfall (Chung Fa). All the rain and growth in the jungle offers a unique challenge. It&#8217;s quite slippery, but this is remedied by pleathera of vines and bamboo hanging and growing out of every corner. While we were hiking we finally got a taste of the new wildlife. Nothing big yet, but lots of new lizards, salamanders, fish, butterflies and beatles. The second tier had the fish that fed on skin particles, so as we swam, we were nibbled at from all angles by a bunch of little fish. We were shedding from a sunburn in Ko Tao, so it worked out.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpid-Photo-20151201185736647.jpg" target="_blank"><img id="blogsy-1448971109233.4675" class="aligncenter" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpid-Photo-20151201185736647.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a></div>
<p>The next days we hiked some more, got lost some more, and ate the spiciest meal of our lives (even the locals next to us were sweating and crying). We went to the beach, body surfed, and got caught in a few storms. Grant was stung by a jelly fish, and his nightmares came true as we stumbled upon spiders the size of our hands.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpid-Photo-20151201185736697.jpg" target="_blank"><img id="blogsy-1448971109199.6367" class="aligncenter" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpid-Photo-20151201185736697.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a></div>
<p>On our last day, we were casually eatting breakfast a place with a view when we notice a log moving swiftly through a stagnant pond. After looking again, it definitely was not a log. It stopped to look at us as it went out of view, but we are pretty sure it was a six-foot water monitor lizard. A freakin&#8217; monster of the modern age.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a sad side note: Khao Lak was also one of the many towns devastated by the 2004 tsunami. The hostel we were in is a mile offshore, but was still under 10ft of water during this disaster. A large police boat was swept past our hostel in the raging waters, and the city left it there as a monument that anyone can see to remember (see picture below). This place is definitely up and coming again, and we were happy to see it doing so well now.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpid-Photo-20151201185736741.jpg" target="_blank"><img id="blogsy-1448971109150.4106" class="aligncenter" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpid-Photo-20151201185736741.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a></div>
