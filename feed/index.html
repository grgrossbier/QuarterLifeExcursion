								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot of things, and I think I&#8217;ve collected 5 tips to travel for less than $100 a month.</p>
<p>Traveling for less than one hundred dollars per month is an absurd budget. If you think about it from a western point of view, that&#8217;s not even enough money to pay rent for a week, so how is someone suppose to live on that for a month abroad? I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s almost incomprehensible, but I met a few people doing just that. They weren&#8217;t dirty, grimy, or shifty westerners though. They were usually travelers from countries with a lower income level than in the West. They of course want to travel too, so they had to get creative with their budget and work as they go.</p>
<p>Those that have tried to meet this budget tell me that they never want to travel any other way. When you must earn money and cut corners to get by, you get to know the locals and the culture at a more intimate level and experience things in a whole new way. Learning to travel for less than rent may be the new way of traveling.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not looking to be this budget crazy, read over my post about general budgeting and saving (coming soon&#8230;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5 Tips to Travel for Less than $100 a month budget:</span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hitch hike.</strong> Use caution and know your area, but bus and air travel are one of the biggest expenses while traveling. If you can avoid it, don&#8217;t pay it. Hitch hiking is also a great way to meet locals and sometimes earn a free meal.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hitch-Hike-1.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-960" title="5 tips to Travel for Less Than 100 a month" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hitch-Hike-1.jpeg" alt="5 tips to Travel for Less Than 100 a month" width="521" height="347" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hitch-Hike-1.jpeg 890w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hitch-Hike-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hitch-Hike-1-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Couchsurfing.</strong> A great website that allows you to sleep at local houses in exchange for a little work or nothing at all. It&#8217;s a great way to meet locals and learn about the city more deeply.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/20160227_085645.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-961" title="5 tips to Travel for Less Than 100 a month" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/20160227_085645-1024x576.jpg" alt="5 tips to Travel for Less Than 100 a month" width="519" height="292" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/20160227_085645-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/20160227_085645-300x169.jpg 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/20160227_085645-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work Exchange and Volunteering.</strong> There are a lot of dumb pay-to-volunteer opportunities out there. Avoid these. Sites like <a href="http://HelpX.net">HelpX.net</a> and <a href="http://WorkAway.info">WorkAway.info</a> are great ways to find real volunteer and work opportunities that allow you to exchange your time for a room and board or maybe a paycheck. You&#8217;ll be teaching English, rebuilding communities, working in hospitality, doing labor, etc, and you&#8217;ll be getting to know the area, the people, and the volunteers for longer periods of time and making longer lasting connections. This is a must on a tight budget, covering hostel costs and food is covering 90% of a tight budget.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160411_142028.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-891" title="5 tips to Travel for Less Than 100 a month" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160411_142028-1024x576.jpg" alt="5 tips to Travel for Less Than 100 a month" width="520" height="292" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160411_142028-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160411_142028-300x169.jpg 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160411_142028-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negotiate and Haggle.</strong> It&#8217;s so obvious, but haggle for everything. The price is almost always negotiable, and you&#8217;ll be surprised how much you can save by simply asking. Pennies turn into dollars and dollars turn into serious savings.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Street-Food.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-959" title="5 tips to Travel for Less Than 100 a month" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Street-Food.jpeg" alt="5 tips to Travel for Less Than 100 a month" width="518" height="292" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Street-Food.jpeg 890w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Street-Food-300x169.jpeg 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Street-Food-768x433.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t Drink.</strong> Alcohol is the biggest waste of money on a tight budget. A local meal in Thailand costs less than a dollar, but the national beer costs $2. Go out at night and drink some tea instead, and you&#8217;ll rally to the break of dawn.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tea.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-958" title="5 tips to Travel for Less Than 100 a month" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tea.jpg" alt="5 tips to Travel for Less Than 100 a month" width="520" height="340" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tea.jpg 890w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tea-300x196.jpg 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tea-768x501.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></a></p>
<p>Finding an actual job is worth noting but may be too obvious. There are jobs all over southeast Asia for travelers and expats, especially in cities. Many travelers find work teaching English or working at a hostel, but other professional jobs exist as well if you&#8217;re not picky about location. With the small earnings you make, you&#8217;ll be able to easily travel on weekend and vacations without dipping into the original budget. Australia also offers one year working visas to many countries, and this is a very popular way to travel and work simultaneously.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Think about it&#8230; you normally live your life in a house, apartment, or room with all of your luxuries around you.  Now imagine that you need to pack everything you need into a bag and that&#8217;s it. Don&#8217;t pack too much because you have to carry it&#8230;.everywhere. Don&#8217;t pack too little because who knows what you&#8217;ll need to be happy, comfortable, and sanitary. What do you pack for Southeast Asia?</p>
<p>What do you take? What is expendable? These were the questions that troubled me the month before leaving on our trip, but I think I&#8217;m finally ready to go. Take a look at the list below, and maybe you&#8217;ll notice something I forgot (fingers crossed that it isn&#8217;t too important), or maybe something you forgot. Overall, this post goes into detail with what I decided to take to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><strong>[Updated!]</strong> I&#8217;ve returned from six months abroad, and I have learned a lot about packing light. I&#8217;ve gone through, edited, omitted, and added a few things here and there. After getting some true experience on the road, I&#8217;m confident that my final pack is perfect for backpacking tropical areas. If you&#8217;re going to colder climates, pack a few more layers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Backpack:</span> </strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I was able to get everything I needed into a 55L two compartment backpack, and all my gear combined is under 25 lbs. I&#8217;ve made the carry-on requirements and I&#8217;m stoked.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151102_123425.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-248 size-large" title="Pack for Southeast Asia" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151102_123425-e1446513770460-1024x642.jpg" alt="Pack for Southeast Asia" width="700" height="439" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151102_123425-e1446513770460-1024x642.jpg 1024w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151102_123425-e1446513770460-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My backpack of choice is the <a href="http://amzn.to/29Dea33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Osprey Farpoint 55</a>. It is a two bag system, a day pack (15L) and a <strong>carry-on</strong>, suitcase-style pack (40L), that zip together for easy travel. The bag opens completely, easily revealing all of its contents when needed, and the straps tuck away, leaving a slim suitcase that travels well. I thought I&#8217;d need a bigger bag, but everything ended up fitting in here no problem, and it&#8217;s within the carry-on limits. This will save me time and money on buses, trains, and planes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Gear:</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Everything I brought is in this photo (except my cell phone). I hope someone can use this photo later to double check there own pack and make sure they have everything.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151102_115544.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-241 size-large" title="Pack for Southeast Asia" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151102_115544-e1446513944147-1024x635.jpg" alt="Pack for Southeast Asia" width="700" height="434" /></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you want to know exactly what I’m bringing, I&#8217;ve labeled and explained everything in the rest of the post. I can&#8217;t recommend any of this gear 100%, but I&#8217;m about to put it all to the test, and I&#8217;ll let everyone know how it holds up at the end. <strong>[Update: I&#8217;ve added and removed gear in the list below with reasons.]</strong></p>

<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What to Pack for Southeast Asia!?</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/In-The-Bag-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-249 size-large" title="Pack for Southeast Asia" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/In-The-Bag-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="Pack for Southeast Asia" width="700" height="394" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/In-The-Bag-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/In-The-Bag-2-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>(Click the image and let it load for more detail) (An index is at the bottom of the post.)<br />
</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clothes:</strong></span></p>
<p>From what I&#8217;ve heard, you can buy anything once you get there, but I also heard that if you&#8217;re gonna spend good money on anything, it should be good clothes to start your journey. Southeast Asia is gonna be warm and humid, so I&#8217;m bringing light clothes that wick moisture well. I&#8217;m not too worried about the cold, but I did bring a few extra layers. My goal here was to create 2 or 3 outfits that can rotate in and out, backpacking style.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hat</strong> [3] &#8211; Critical for staying out of the sun. Energy levels after a day with and without a hat is significant.</li>
<li><strong>Outdoor Pants</strong> (2 Pair) [5]
<ul>
<li>Both rugged and one nicer (or at least cleaner) pair for city night life. Don&#8217;t bring jeans to a tropical climate. Trust me. They&#8217;ll sit at the bottom of the bag, weighing you down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sandals</strong> [6] &#8211; Leave the heavy sandles at home unless you have bad feet. Light and quick is key.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29De6QB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walking/Trekking Shoes</a></strong> [8]
<ul>
<li>I looked for a blend of comfort, aesthetic, and tough and found these.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Polarized Sunglasses</strong> [20]</li>
<li><strong>Long Sleeve Light Jacket</strong> [25]</li>
<li><strong>Synth Underwear</strong> (4 Pair) [26] &#8211; Laundry days will be few and far between so buy some underwear that doesn&#8217;t stink after a day of use.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DZLVIZM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00DZLVIZM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trablo0c-20&amp;linkId=SGKSI6GYPZYKIZSC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exofficio</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29Fzt7i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch</a></strong> [28] &#8211; Waterproof with basic functions.</li>
<li><strong>Down Jacket</strong> [42]
<ul>
<li>Wait for a sale, and you can get the <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/883335/rei-revelcloud-jacket-mens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REI Revelcloud</a> at a good price.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Electronics / Entertainment:</strong></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve broken it down to what&#8217;s needed to take pictures, blog, and keep myself sane. After the trip, I regretted a few items. For example, a goPro is awesome, but carrying any camera around besides my phone was a total drag. Besides the occasional dive, the goPro never made it out of my pack.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29EO6q8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small BlueTooth Speaker</a></strong> [8]</li>
<li><strong><del><a href="http://amzn.to/29IzuIR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoPro</a></del></strong> [16] &#8211; Besides the occasional water day, the goPro never made it out of the bag. I was 100% content with my phone camera.</li>
<li><strong><del><a href="http://amzn.to/2aaJtUs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POV GoPro Strap Mount</a></del></strong> [15] &#8211; No GoPro, no mount, but this thing is a super handy POV camera and a sturdy out-of-pocket holster.</li>
<li><strong><del>SD Card Adapter</del></strong> [17] &#8211; Never made it out of the bag.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29FzS9K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MoleSkine Notebook</a></strong> [18] &#8211; An awesome way to remember your trip is to immortalize it in a daily dairy. Just some quick bullet points to solidify the highlights, the people, and the best experiences. You&#8217;ll be able to look back years later and remember it all over again.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29ENUaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPad</a></strong> [19] &#8211; I’ve decided to leave the laptop behind in favor of an iPad. The liability and anxiety of carrying a fragile / expensive laptop isn’t worth the small amount of remote work I may be able to find during these first few months traveling.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29KfynY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portable Battery</a></strong> [21] &#8211; A <strong>must have</strong> if you&#8217;re carrying/using electronics on the move. It saved us every week when we were back where we shouldn&#8217;t be and in need of GPS. The battery I linked is the best  balence between size, weight, and charge I could find.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29IzSam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Plug Adapter</a></strong> [22] &#8211; Buy one with USB ports so you can leave the wall adapters at home.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2aaJR5t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NOMAD ChargeKey (MicroUSB)</a></strong> [23] &#8211; The perfect compliment to the portable battery. Also available with a <a href="http://amzn.to/2aaJ9p5">Lightning Cable</a> (iPhones)</li>
<li><del><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29IAuws">GoPro Tripod</a></strong></del> [35] &#8211; An awesome tool if I wanted to bring my goPro again. Set up good photos, time lapses, or use it as a nice handle.</li>
<li><strong><del><a href="http://amzn.to/2aaJLuF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NOMAD ChargeClip (MiniUSB/GoPro)</a></del></strong> [36] &#8211; An awesome tool if I were to bring the goPro again.</li>
<li><strong>Charge Cables</strong> [37]</li>
<li><strong>Book</strong> [39] &#8211; Make it a good one and leave the travel book at home. This is the 21st century.</li>

<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29QYcrO"><strong>Phone</strong></a> (Not Pictured) [58] &#8211; I’m taking my phone, but ditching the service. Wifi, coupled with apps like What’s App and Maps.Me is just enough for me to communicate back home and navigate around. Check out my post about using a phone abroad and <a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/2016/06/must-travel-apps/">the best apps for backpacking</a>! And ALWAYS get a <a href="http://amzn.to/2aaJUya">good case</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Necessities:</strong></span></p>
<p>I might be bringing some of these things out of camping habit, but you never know.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.terrevistatrails.com/jag-bag-standard-extra-long.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silk Bag Liner</a></strong> [1]
<ul>
<li><strong>Sleeping Bag vs Liner:</strong> From what I can tell, it’s never going to get much colder than 60F in Thailand and most of SEA. That combined with bare bone hostel accommodations, and my desire to eliminate unnecessary gear made me ditch the sleeping bag in favor of a nice silk sleeping bag liner. I got mine (Item 1) from JagBag and it’s awesome. I already did a couple nights with it while visiting friends. Basically, it’s just enough to keep you comfortable and bed bug free.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><del>Draw String Bag</del></strong> [2] &#8211; Buy a dry bag once you&#8217;re there. It&#8217;s the same thing but safer.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29Dea33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Osprey Farpoint 55 Backpack</a></strong> [4] &#8211; See first section, but just to say it again, this backpack is awesome! Fits everything comfortably and packs light. Not to mention, it counts as a carry on!</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29DfWB3"><strong>Head Lamp</strong></a> [10] &#8211; Buy this as soon as you can. They are beyond convenient, so much so you&#8217;ll never want to use a normal flashlight again. Hands free is the way to be.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2aaKuMp"><strong>Bug Spray</strong></a> [11] &#8211; REI has THE BEST all natural spray. It smells good, and it worked better for me than 100% deet (and it didn&#8217;t melt my clothes). I&#8217;ll die with stuff on.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29wy18T"><strong>Iodine Pills</strong></a> [13] &#8211; For water purification in a pinch.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29Dgg2V"><strong>Backpacking Towel</strong></a> [14] &#8211; Light weight and drys quickly. Just don&#8217;t forget it at the first hostel.</li>
<li><del><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29DglUh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydration Bladder</a></strong></del> [27] &#8211; Since I had to buy bottles every time I needed drinking water, it never made sense to use the bladder. I would not bring it next time.</li>
<li><strong>Doxycycline</strong> (Malaria Pills) [31]</li>
<li><strong>Lighter</strong> [32]</li>
<li><del><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29EeR2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map (Southeast Asia)</a></strong></del> [41] &#8211; With Maps.ME app and the internet, this never made it out of the bag.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29IB9On" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mini Flash Light</a></strong> [47] &#8211; Just in case, they are very handy in a pinch</li>
<li><strong>First Aid Kit (See Section)</strong> [59] &#8211; The minimalist kit needs Neosporin, bandages, drugs, superglue, duct tape, and hand sanitizer.</li>
<li><strong>Passport</strong> [60] &#8211; Protect this at all costs.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Toiletries:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disposable Razor</strong> [12]
<ul>
<li>Allowed on the plane. I checked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deodorant</strong> [29] &#8211; Bring a full size, you&#8217;ll never find normal stick deodorant in SE Asia.</li>
<li><strong>Sunscreen</strong> [30] &#8211; Bring what you can. It&#8217;s no cheaper there, and most brands include a whitening powder.</li>
<li><strong>Toothbrush</strong> [44]</li>
<li><strong>Soaps</strong> [45] &#8211; You&#8217;ll end up buying full size bottles if you&#8217;re there for more than a month. Leave the travel bottles at home, and bring what you can.</li>
<li><strong>Common</strong> <strong>Pills</strong> [46]
<ul>
<li>Vit C, B12, Advil, Melatonin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Toilet Paper</strong> [55] &#8211; Carry this on you, ALWAYS. Code browns can become frighteningly real, and bathrooms never carry toilet paper for you.</li>
<li><strong>Hand Sanitizer</strong> [56]</li>
<li><strong>Toiletry Satchel</strong> [57] &#8211; Such a great and convenient purchase. You can be in and out of shower in minutes since everything is always ready.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Other:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29Ef2ug" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Packing Cubes</a></strong> [7] &#8211; Awesome for bag organization. It seems tedious, but it&#8217;s way faster in the long run.</li>
<li><del><strong>Bug Net</strong></del> [9] &#8211; Never used it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29wyR5k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extra Waist Buckle</a></strong> [24] &#8211; Just in case the apathetic bus driver or airline smashes yours.</li>
<li><strong>Rope (30&#8242;)</strong> [33] &#8211; Drying laundry, tying off boats, making improvised fixes, a rope is a priceless item.</li>
<li><del><strong>Sink Plug</strong></del> [34] &#8211; Better idea: Use a plastic bag from a grocery store for laundry, and you&#8217;ll be able to agitate all your laundry at once.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29Pm7Gy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Travel Pouch</a></strong> [38] &#8211; Passport security.</li>
<li><strong>Carabineers</strong> [48] &#8211; Just like a rope, it has a thousand uses. Take a couple.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29DgEhD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Locks</a></strong> [49] &#8211; Take two or three, and maybe some metal wire. $10 for security is worth not getting things stolen. Thiefs look for opportunity, so simple security is usually enough to deter them.</li>
<li><strong>Pen</strong> [52]</li>
<li><del><strong>False Wallet</strong></del> [61] &#8211; Still a good idea, but I never used it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/29xVPpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sleeping Eye Cover</a></strong> [62] &#8211; This and the ear plugs are MUST HAVES. On trains and buses, in hostels, around construction or noisey neighbors, where ever, a comfortable eye cover and ear plugs make all the problems go away while you&#8217;re trying to sleep.</li>
<li>Ear Plugs [Not Pictured] &#8211; Good sleep is priceless.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A few notes:</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Purchased once I arrived:</strong> These things are amazingly useful and cheap to buy once you&#8217;re there. No need to by one at home, you&#8217;ll find the same thing for a better price on the road.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dry Bag</strong> &#8211; Priceless during a short hike or any time water my be a factor. Beat it up. Get it wet. Never worry about your gear or about the bag. They are designed for abuse, even the cheap ones.</li>
<li><strong>Sarong</strong> &#8211; Guy or girl, this is priceless. It&#8217;s a towel, a blanket, a cover, a shoulder cover for mosques, or anything else you may think of. They can usually be bought for a few dollars at a night market.</li>
<li><strong>Umbrella or Pancho</strong> &#8211; Leave the rain gear at home, they are to hot for the tropical climates. There may be two days a year where you may want it, but the rest of the year, an umbrella is perfect for keeping you dryer and happier. If the rain is too bad or horizontal, buy a pancho for a few dollars. They are quite convenient, and they cover your backpack too!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Leave it at home:</strong> I brought a lot of things I didn&#8217;t need. Review the lists above and notice the items I crossed out. I&#8217;m not bringing those next time. I didn&#8217;t use them or they weren&#8217;t as useful as I thought. Either way, I&#8217;ll save the weight next time.</p>

<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First Aid Kit:</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was First Responder certified, some of my first questions had to do with making a good first-aid kit. I didn’t find much help in pre-made kits, so I had to get some advice and make my own. For those interested, here’s what I think is always good to have on hand:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(Disclosure: I’m not a doctor, EMT, or paramedic. I’m a WMI first responder, nothing more. This kit could always have more and better supplies, but this is what I’ve deemed necessary to have on hand at all times.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Penang is known as the food capital of Malaysia. Grant and I, being food motivated people through and through, were really excited to eat our faces off.  Our hostel was located within Little India in the city of Penang.  As a result, masala tea, roti, and curry smells wafted down the streets constantly.  There was more than once we were planning on venturing out for some Chinese or Malaysian food, and ended up going for Indian because it smelled way too good to pass up.</p>
<p>Our goal was to try everything on the brochure we were handed day one. (This is the compressed version.)</p>

We were also able to meet up with one of our friends from our island volunteering session! It was extremely hot during the hike, but the view at the end was worth the walk.</p>

We couldn&#8217;t pass up $2.50 movies in a nice theater with winter cool A/C!</p>
<p>All in all, Penang was a great city that we enjoyed wandering throughout, slamming food, basking in A/C, and people watching.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Danielle and Grant</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were very excited to find out that a campground on the beautiful Perhentian Islands had two volunteer vacancies that Grant and I would be filling for a month. It sounded too good to be true: bioluminescent plankton, turtles laying eggs, great snorkeling right next to our accommodation, and our own private beach for a month long. We made a pact beforehand&#8230;if the accommodation wasn&#8217;t up to our (minimal) standards or we began working way too much we would leave early. And with that in mind, with about five books among us in case we were deathly bored, we made our way to Rainforest Campground on the &#8216;little island&#8217; of the Perhentians.</p>

No dock, just jump off the front of the boat. Private beach: check. A pirate and Malaysian flag, hand painted signs all over the place, several bamboo structures, and tons of friendly people greeted us as we made our way to the reception counter.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: small;">We met the other volunteers (including a Danielle from California&#8230;this was about to get confusing) and the owners who all seemed like incredibly laid back people. We were given the rundown: the cafe and bar has to be manned, tents and bathrooms need to be cleaned, and labor needed to be completed. Easy. In exchange for our time, we were fed and housed for free for a month. Kickass!</span><br />

It came equipped with three of the most massive geckos I had ever seen (later to be named Ali, Mercury, and Falsto).</span></p>

Giant monitor lizards, sea eagles, stingrays, and black tipped reef sharks were things that we saw daily. Vipers, territorial monkeys, and sea turtle tracks on our beach were special sightings. I had to continue to remind myself that we were staying in a rainforest, because some of these sightings became so commonplace. Turtles and amazing snorkeling: check and check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160327_174523.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-875" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160327_174523-576x1024.jpg" alt="20160327_174523" width="300" height="533" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160327_174523-576x1024.jpg 576w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160327_174523-169x300.jpg 169w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160327_174523-768x1365.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></span><span style="font-size: small;">We learned more about the island as we explored around. Long beach is a fairly dirty, party beach where nightlife (including crappy house music) can be heard well into the early morning. It makes for great sunrises though, as it is east-facing. Coral bay, on the west side of the island is a bit classier with nicer eating and resort options. We would walk over to coral beach for milkshakes and wifi as needed. Our beach was a 25 minute walk south of coral bay, on a beautiful path leading through the rain forest. This island is unique in the fact there is not a single car, truck, or vehicle of any kind on it. Boat taxis are plentiful however, and many times we could hear tourists screaming as the drivers tend to go as fast as possible between point A and point B. The fishing &#8220;village&#8221; on the south tip of the island, is is more like a local town.<br />

<p><span style="font-size: small;">A couple of times we made it to the fishing &#8220;village&#8221; for breakfast (always before <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1176833514"><span class="aQJ">8 AM</span></span> to snag local prices).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160408_084117.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-889 size-large" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160408_084117-576x1024.jpg" alt="20160408_084117" width="576" height="1024" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160408_084117-576x1024.jpg 576w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160408_084117-169x300.jpg 169w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160408_084117-768x1365.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a> </span><span style="font-size: small;">We also spent a day scuba diving, which is always awesome. One spot had horrible visibility so we spent the duration of our time diving through underwater caves. It was a lot of fun. The day we spent kayaking was great because we could spot good snorkeling areas as we were cruising over them.</span></p>

While there, an Italian couple that were patrons-turned-volunteers, spent all day preparing for homemade pizza night (cheese included). We all ate way to much that night. They also taught us how to make homemade pasta and gnocchi!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160404_142142.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-881 size-large" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160404_142142-1024x576.jpg" alt="20160404_142142" width="700" height="394" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160404_142142-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160404_142142-300x169.jpg 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160404_142142-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></span><span style="font-size: small;">And we ended up seeing the bioluminescent plankton! Check. Apparently, it is always in the water but there is so much light pollution on other beaches on the island it is impossible to spot elsewhere. For 4 or 5 nights in a row, around the new moon, we grabbed snorkel gear and headed to the beach. It was incredible to see the little bits of light spiraling around our moving body parts. The light from the stars in the sky and ocean were almost interchangeable. It was also hilarious to see grown adults flailing around as much as possible to disturb the plankton into glowing bright. Shouts of &#8220;You&#8217;re a wizard, Harry&#8221; were screamed. We were surprised to see fireflys floating through where the rainforest hits the beach. We were surrounded by points of light in the sky, ocean, and air around us. It was one of the most magical things I have seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Even though my days weren&#8217;t spent doing all that much, I still found myself wishing there was more hours in every day. The volunteers, patrons, and owners of the place were all really great people to talk to and I often spent an entire day sitting in the cafe chatting with whoever was down there. Rainforest Campground is beautiful, and attracts beautiful people in return. It wasn&#8217;t uncommon to hear about folks deciding to stay with us after wondering down to our beach randomly, or extending their stay by a week or so once they see what the place has to offer. We had so many laughs there as well as deep conversations about internal struggles, politics, and dreams. One of the volunteers led beach yoga sessions in the mornings. One patron painted a beautiful mural in our cafe. People were often seen meditating on the beach. Our place was magical. I&#8217;m going to miss Rainforest quite a bit. </span></p>

I feel grateful to have the memories I will take home from this place.  Hopefully we will meet again, Rainforest.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We flew from KK to Kota Bharu without a problem.  We finally made it to peninsular Malaysia! While trekking around Borneo, we heard that the island culture is different from the mainland, so we were interested to see the differences for ourselves. One major thing we noticed: religion is much more prevalent within the peninsula.</p>
<p>Kota Bharu is a little dull compared to some of the other places we had visited. Day one we attempted to walk through a few museums that we had researched in advance, only to find them completely closed. So instead, we wandered around the city to see the sights and people watch. We did find a delicious lunch restaurant and enjoyed being the only westerners at the tiny place we were eating at. Eventually, we made it back to our hostel to relax before more food!</p>

We would soon notice more and more how different the westerners were in Malaysia. As a Muslim country, Malaysia attracts a different sort of person than any other southeast Asian country we had visited so far. I think the way alcohol is frowned upon (or completely banned depending where you go) is one of the main factors.  We hardly found the &#8216;partying type&#8217; in Malaysia, which was fairly refreshing after a handful of obnoxious people we met on the trip at various points (the worst were the ones in the same dorm as you with no regard for the time of day, night, or level of noise they were making). Most traveling folks we met in Malaysia had more love for experiencing people or the culture than than a night out on the town. It was one of the appeals of the country.</p>

<p><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160325_184456.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-864 size-large" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160325_184456-1024x576.jpg" alt="20160325_184456" width="700" height="394" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160325_184456-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160325_184456-300x169.jpg 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160325_184456-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a>He supplied cheese-filled hotdogs (&#8220;what westerners eat&#8221;, right?) along with some Malaysian dishes made by his mom that were more to my taste.  While there, we chatted with the locals and learned a lot about the Malaysian culture.  Something that surprised us was the amount of racism that Chinese Malaysians felt from some of the Malay citizens as well as the government. On a lighter note, we also learned that it is illegal in the state we were in to buy or sell any sort of alcohol.  Apparently, the beer they were passing around comes from Thailand because it is cheaper/easier to cross the boarder than to find it elsewhere in Malaysia. Crazy.</p>

If you do go there, however, look up the cultural shows. They are quite cool apparently, but are only on certain days of the week (days we weren&#8217;t there unfortunately).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Semporna, Sipadan, Mabul, and Kapalai. This is the holy grail for scuba divers. Semporna, a kind of sketchy and rag-tag town, is the departure point for about a a dozen islands and nearly a hundred unique dive sites. Mabul is a resort and sea gypsy island known for the macro-diving and underwater photography opportunities. Kapalai is a high end resort island with plenty of diving for all budgets. Sipadan is truly the holy grail, however. Whale sharks, turtles, manta rays, schools of fish 40ft wide, and 100ft visibility. The diamond of Malaysian diving in Borneo.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Photo-20160616092548057.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title=""><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Photo-20160616092548057.jpg" id="blogsy-1466094352388.489" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="281"></a></div>
<p>I wish I had the money to dive there, but we didn&#39;t. Instead we enjoyed two days of non-stop diving throughout the other two islands, and it was a stellar experience. We&#39;ll be back for Sipadan, one day.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Photo-20160616092548120.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Photo-20160616092548120.jpg" id="blogsy-1466094352410.1526" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="281"></a></div>
<p>To get to Mabul, our destination island, we took a bus and found ourselves sitting in the stairwell of a crowded bus for the second time. Why are these things always so crowded? After landing in Semporna and noting the sketchy vibe, we shipped out to Mabul to stay with a dive center called ScubaJunkie.</p>
<p>Mabul is the island where &#8220;macro-diving&#8221; or &#8220;muck diving&#8221; was invented. Although the visibility is mediocre, the reef is brilliantly colored and it hosts an array of intricate and beautiful small species. It&#39;s common to see cuttlefish, octopus, turtles, sea horses and nudibranchs. The island is also home to a population of sea gypsys. Many of these nomadic village people don&#39;t have a citizenship with any country and vary between living on the island and in the sea. </p>
<p>ScubaJunkie turned out to be an awesome company for reasons beyond the dives. To start, they have created a turtle hatchery and emergency rescue center, with hope to offset the human impact on the beaches. Next, they host weekly beach clean ups, and they have started to get the village involved in helping and learning about the environment, littering, and sustainable fishing. The dive center refuses to serve local fish until the villagers fish sustainably. Also, they give out and collect biodegradable trash bags from the villagers so they can stop littering directly into the ocean, and hire local help. Finally, they do their part to create awareness about the fall of the shark populations (10% left) and banning shark fin soup.</p>
<p>On to the diving&#8230; One word: Awesome!</p>
<p>I apologize in advance, we didn&#39;t take pictures. We didn&#39;t want to fiddle with a camera, composition, and angles, so we selfishly enjoyed all of it to ourselves.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Photo-20160616092548178.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Photo-20160616092548178.jpg" id="blogsy-1466094352425.1824" class="aligncenter" width="500" height="281" alt=""></a></div>
<p>We dove through reefs, walls, drop offs, artificial reefs, and sandy bottoms. We dove in the morning, afternoon, and even the night. We were basically alone (besides the dive master) the whole time. We explored coral and navigated underwater village reefs. We swam through schools of barracuda and watched cuttlefish hunt. We found moray eels thicker than me, and spotted octopus, squid, porcupine fish, orangutan crabs, and frog fish. It was great.</p>
<p>On the side, we played volleyball with the locals, took saltwater showers (no fresh water taps on the island), talked about future dives, and ate.</p>
<p>On the way out we enjoyed some delicious food from Semporna and finally took a fresh water shower. Now, back to KK and then the peninsula!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Credit and debit cards are extremely important while traveling. That itself is a bit of a no brainer. Everyone should have at least two or three cards with them just in case one expires, gets lost, or fails. Unfortunately, not everyone knows everything they should about using cards abroad. In the following I&#8217;ll show you why you need more cards, how they can fail, and how you can SAVE HUNDREDS of dollars on fees.</p>
<p>Everything I wrote about, I wrote from experience. I invite all the readers to continue the discussion and comment with there own tips, tricks, knowledge, experience and stories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW AHEAD OF TIME</strong></span></h5>
<p>This is the basics. Make sure you understand all of this before you leave, so you aren&#8217;t caught off guard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit cards are <em>rarely</em> accepted anywhere except the airport (within SEA specifically):</strong> After 6 months of travel, I don&#8217;t even need one hand to count the number of physical stores I used my credit card in. I never used it. I still needed it though. The credit card is great for flexing its benefits when buying plane tickets, booking hostels on your phone, and at the airport before you can find a currency exchange. It can also act as an ATM card in a pinch.</li>
<li><strong>Most cards charge a hefty foreign transaction fee:</strong> Up to 3%, I hear. These fees will break you down if you are not careful. Luckily, many cards advertise themselves as travel cards, with no foreign transaction fees, and do not have these fees. Shop for your credit card wisely and keep this in mind. See my card suggestions at the end for a good example.</li>
<li><strong>Every ATM charges fees:</strong> ATM fees in SE Asia vary from $3 &#8211; 10. With the steep fees, most people are stuck between sucking it up and paying it often, or carrying loads of cash on them in each country (that is not recommended for obvious reasons). There is one exceptional bank that will refund you all ATM fees that are charged. Schwab, and its excellent free checking/investor account, saved my girlfriend and I over $300 in ATM fees after six month. More information about this account can be found at the end of the article.</li>
<li><strong>The banks will shut down your account if you don&#8217;t tell them you will be traveling:</strong> Don&#8217;t forget to call them. Should only take 2-10 minutes depending on the bank.</li>
<li><strong>Cards expire:</strong> No duh, but don&#8217;t forget to check.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t expect to find an ATM right when you get to a new country. </strong>Be ready and have about $50 in USD stashed in your pack for emergencies, and a bit of pre-exchanged local currency ready.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How a card can fail and why you need more than one:</strong></span></h6>
<p>Three stories summed up in a sentence each:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The ATM charged me but I didn&#8217;t get any money, and now my bank shut my card down for suspicious activity.</strong> Always keep receipts for cancelled and failed transactions. Try to always visit an ATM that is attached to the associated bank. Frequently check your account, especially after a strange interaction with an ATM. Remember that a credit card can act as an emergency debit card (cash advancing), but try not to use it since there are commonly extra fees involved.</li>
<li><strong>The bank was hacked, and now they sent me a new card, but obviously I&#8217;m not home anymore.</strong> Note: They will send you a new card to an international address if you can wait it out and know where you&#8217;ll be.</li>
<li><strong>I&#8217;m an idiot, and didn&#8217;t check my expiration date.</strong> It happened to me, and I&#8217;m not proud of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are three damn good reasons to carry an extra credit and debit card from a different bank on the side when traveling. Stash them deep in your bag for safety. They weigh nothing and if you ever need them you&#8217;ll be stoked that you brought them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saving money on fees and beating the system:</strong></span></h6>
<p><strong>Foreign transaction fees:</strong> There are dozens of banks and creditors that offer cards, for free, without foreign transaction fees. Find one! 3% is a lot of money to be paying on a long trip that is tight on funds.</p>
<p><strong>ATM fees:</strong> Unless you&#8217;re using the <a href="http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account">Schwab High Yield Investor Checking Account</a>, you&#8217;ll likely be paying ATM fees at every ATM you see. Beat these fees by withdrawing large sums of money at ATMs. Balance the risk of carrying cash with the cost of the ATM, but I usually took out 10-14 days worth of cash ($200-500) and split it between my bag and my wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Cash back and rewards cards:</strong> Most credit cards come with a 1% cash back on certain purchases. Some cards, come with even better deals, with cash back percentages reaching over 3% in certain categories. Even better cards sweeten the deal buy offering decent sums of money (in reward points) if you spend enough money or keep the card long enough. The <a href="http://www.findmybarclaycard.com/barclaycard-credit-cards/arrival-plus/">Barclay Arrival Plus</a>, I&#8217;ll talk about below offers 40,000 points (about $300) if you spend $3000 in the first three months. If you can meet these demands and still make the payments, it&#8217;s almost free money.</p>
<h6><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My cards:</strong></span></h6>
<p>These three cards combined, have earned and saved me over $600 in a year of travel and preparation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Schwab High Yield Investor Checking Account:</strong></span></a><br />
I didn&#8217;t think to look at a brokerage firm for a checking account, <em>but this account has been a god send</em>. <strong>No ATM fees!</strong> Excellent customer service! No foreign exchange fees! This one of a kind account will eventually become the backpacker&#8217;s standard.<br />
<strong>Pros:</strong> Refunded ATM fees. No foreign exchange fees. Market price exchange rates. Excellent customer service. Short hold times. Decent web and app platforms.<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Transferring money from a main account at another bank wirelessly takes about 5 business days. Physical banks are few and far between in the states. Hopefully there is one near you. Initial set up may need to be done in person. This is an old school bank.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/credit-cards/products/bankamericard-travel-rewards-credit-card/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BofA TravelRewards Card:</strong></span></a><br />
Standard card with no foreign transaction fees. Visa. My back up card. No pros, no cons. Super standard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.findmybarclaycard.com/barclaycard-credit-cards/arrival-plus/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Barclay Arrival+:</strong></span></a><br />
Awesome card with an excellent set of perks, especially the initial rewards offer. No foreign transaction fees. The first year is free, but after that, you need to pay $95/yr, so don&#8217;t forget to cancel the card before the year is up.<br />
<strong>Pros:</strong> 2% Cash back. No foreign transaction fees. Cash advances available (at cost). MasterCard. Huge 40,000 point reward offer. Good customer service. Free for first year.<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> $95/yr after first year (remember to cancel it). Not Visa. Needs decent credit to get approval.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a lot of joy and relief in leaving your phone behind as you go explore the world. There is also a lot of joy in having a basic GPS, the ability to check flights, and taking pictures on the go. Basically, there are pros and cons to taking a phone with you. I personally brought my phone but left my data plans at home and operated with whatever Wi-Fi I could find. Eventually I got a SIM card for the last month and a half as I began looking for work again. Everyone will make a different decision about their phone, but if you do decide to take your phone, here are a few notes that may be useful:</p>
<ol>
<li>Almost all apps operate perfectly on Wi-Fi only. The exceptions being calls and text, of course. Read my other post, <a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/2016/06/must-travel-apps/">Best Backpacker Travel Apps for Free</a>, for the best travel apps. They are all offline or Wi-Fi based.</li>
<li>GPS still works without service and without data.</li>
<li>Bring a plug adapter with USB ports to make your life easy, and bring an external battery for extra life in a pinch.</li>
<li>The camera in your Galaxy or iPhone is just as good as any point and shoot camera. Save yourself the weight and leave the little camera at home.</li>
<li>International plans are available from major American providers, but they are generally expensive (additional $40/month).</li>
<li>There are international data providers in the region you&#8217;re traveling. If your phone is unlocked, you just need to change SIM cards and pay a new company. Most are pay as you go, have no contracts, and are very cheap! Do the research and find the right company for you.</li>
<li>New regional data plans and SIM cards can be brought after you arrive in the country from a huge variety of stores. They are super cheap.
<ol>
<li>Example data plan: Malaysia, CELCOM company, XPax Magic SIM card, 2.5 Gb/month of 4GLTE service plus text and calls from a Malay number for $10/month plus $2.50 for the SIM card.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Most cell phones, especially new 4G phones, come unlocked now including all iPhone 5&#8217;s and 6&#8217;s. This means you can easily put in a SIM card from an international provider.</li>
<li>As of 2014 and the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act, all phones that have been paid for must be unlocked by the carrier on request. Many companies now ask you to pay for the phone in installments over time so they can get around this.</li>
</ol>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether or not you travel with a fully functional smart phone is a personal choice. Many people, including myself, want to disconnect from the constant buzzing of notifications, text messages, emails and phone calls. 50% of it is spam and clickbait anyway. Allowing yourself to permanently put your phone on silent is one of the huge perks of traveling.</p>
<p>Even though we don&#8217;t want to have a data and phone plan abroad, that doesn&#8217;t mean we should ditch the phone entirely. This is the 21st century and a thousand little convenient tools can all be used with the smart phone. With a proper tool kit of apps on your phone, you&#8217;ll find yourself surprisingly prepared for travel anywhere.</p>
<p>Below are the best apps to make traveling easier and better.</p>
<p><strong>Maps.ME:</strong> [Offline Maps]  #1 Must have backpa<a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mapsme.png"><img class="wp-image-830 alignright" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mapsme.png" alt="Mapsme" width="104" height="104" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mapsme.png 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mapsme-150x150.png 150w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mapsme-230x230.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 104px) 100vw, 104px" /></a>ckers app. This off-line map/GPS app was a godsend in every country we visited. Not only were we navigating busy cities like a local, we were following trails, finding lesser known attractions, and spotting emergency toilets like a pro. All the locations on the app are crowd-sourced, you can add locations of your own or simply add and share personal locations with their simple interface and tools.</p>
<p><strong>Google Translate:</strong> [Universal Translator] Ther<a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Google-Translate.png"><img class="wp-image-831 alignright" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Google-Translate.png" alt="Google Translate" width="95" height="95" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Google-Translate.png 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Google-Translate-150x150.png 150w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Google-Translate-230x230.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 95px) 100vw, 95px" /></a>e are no good offline translate apps. Google Translate at least allows you to save a list of your favorite translations for offline reference. Do the research on Wi-Fi in the hostel and you&#8217;ll be butchering the language to the local&#8217;s amusement in no time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If you want an offline app, consider a basic English to Other dictionary app.</p>
<p><strong>XE Currency Exchange:</strong> [Updated exchange rates] Don&#8217;t get screwed, reference this app. Of course this app does not work offline, since rates change everyday, but it&#8217;ll keep the old data saved for reference till you do fond Wi-Fi. Set up your preferences to view the currencies you&#8217;ll be using and refresh. Easy.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://hostelworld.com">Hostelworld</a>:</strong> [Hostel and hotel booking] Comparable to <a href="http://agoda.com">Agoda</a>, <a href="http://airbnb.com">AirBnb</a>, <a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Hostelworld.png"><img class=" wp-image-833 alignright" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Hostelworld-300x300.png" alt="Hostelworld" width="86" height="86" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Hostelworld-300x300.png 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Hostelworld-150x150.png 150w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Hostelworld-230x230.png 230w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Hostelworld.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 86px) 100vw, 86px" /></a><a href="http://hotels.com">Hotels.com</a> and <a href="http://booking.com">Booking.com</a>, but I found that Hostelworld had the best rates, the easiest interface, the most reasonable options for a backpacker, and the best and most honest rating system. Hostel with 8.0 rating and less than $10/night? Sold.</p>
<p><strong>Bank and Credit Card apps:</strong> Get them, use them, love them. It&#8217;s easier and faster than the web for checking on your finances. Read our post on credit cards and banks for useful travel tips (coming soon).<a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Hangouts-Dialer.png"><img class=" wp-image-834 alignright" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Hangouts-Dialer.png" alt="Hangouts Dialer" width="80" height="80" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Hangouts-Dialer.png 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Hangouts-Dialer-150x150.png 150w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Hangouts-Dialer-230x230.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Hangouts Dialer:</strong> [Free Wi-Fi dialer] Call anywhere in the United States or Canada for FREE using Wi-Fi. No mutual friendship required. I couldn&#8217;t believe it either when I heard it. This app saved me when I needed to call my banks and possible employers who didn&#8217;t have WhatsApp<a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whatsapp.png"><img class="wp-image-835 alignright" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whatsapp.png" alt="whatsapp" width="80" height="80" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whatsapp.png 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whatsapp-150x150.png 150w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/whatsapp-230x230.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>WhatsApp:</strong> [$0.99 to call or text any contacts] Texting and Calling between mutual friends on WhatsApp. Super convenient and super easy.</p>
<p><strong>Dropbox:</strong> [Photos and file sharing] A must have for backing up photos and videos on the go. It&#8217;s also a great <a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dropbox.png"><img class=" wp-image-836 alignright" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dropbox.png" alt="dropbox" width="88" height="88" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dropbox.png 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dropbox-150x150.png 150w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dropbox-230x230.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 88px) 100vw, 88px" /></a>way to share high res photos with friends all at once by simply sending them a link. (I&#8217;ve recently heard that <em>Google Photos</em> is making this even easier, more organized, and more accessible.) Dropbox is also great for sharing media files like movies and music.</p>
<p><strong>AirAsia App:</strong> [Flights] It is the worst app to work with but if you&#8217;re flying around SE Asia on a dime, you&#8217;re most likely gonna be flying AirAisa. Fortunately, the app works better than the mobile site, so be glad about that. Also, always check AirAsia&#8217;s direct rates before booking through any third party for the same flight.</p>
<p><strong>Kayak and Skyscanner: </strong>[Budget flight finder] Besides AirAsia itself, these are the two apps with the best deals on airfare consistently.</p>
<p><strong>Google Keeps:</strong> [Notes and bucket lists] Write down names, e<a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/keeps.png"><img class=" wp-image-837 alignright" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/keeps.png" alt="keeps" width="84" height="84" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/keeps.png 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/keeps-150x150.png 150w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/keeps-230x230.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 84px) 100vw, 84px" /></a>mails, and notes in a second. Our memory is crap, but if it&#8217;s written down, it&#8217;s forever. Google keeps isn&#8217;t the best notes app in many categorizes, but its simple, online, offline, and sharable.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> [Friends and relationships] Maybe you&#8217;re trying to get away from social media, but 98% of travelers have one and it&#8217;s the easiest way to keep in touch with travel friends.</p>
<p><strong>Spotify:</strong> [Music] If you can afford it, you can have all the music you need saved offline for listening on the go.</p>
<p><strong>Podcast Addict:</strong> [Podcasts and music] Podcast are a <a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/podcast-addict.png"><img class=" wp-image-838 alignright" src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/podcast-addict.png" alt="podcast addict" width="98" height="98" srcset="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/podcast-addict.png 300w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/podcast-addict-150x150.png 150w, http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/podcast-addict-230x230.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 98px) 100vw, 98px" /></a>great way to spend a long bus ride.

<p><strong>Play Books:</strong> [Paperless Books] Googles basic eReader app is perfect for reading .epub or .pdf files on the go. It even includes a great internal offline dictionary. Books are heavy and phones use battery, so it&#8217;s good to have a book in both categories. Nothing is sadder than ten hours on a bus without a book.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Borneo is one of those islands that make you think about dense jungles, diverse wildlife, harsh terrain, and untouched backcountry. It truly is a gorgeous island. Our next stop on the island is a guest house right on the edge of the wild Kinabatangan River, known for a wide array of bird life, crocodile infestation, and easy to spot mammals like monkeys and the occasional elephant. As we drove into this region, we admired the lush green forest in front of our eyes, until we started to notice a pattern.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Photo-20160523170937560.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Photo-20160523170937560.jpg" id="blogsy-1464048604540.2695" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="281"></a></div>
<p>Palms, palms, palms, and more palm trees. We noticed this from the plane as well. Unfortunately, a huge amount of primary forest has been decimated in the last century for palm oil. It&#39;s unfortunate to see and everyone hopes to see progress begin moving back in the right direction. As green as the palm plantations are, they don&#39;t support diverse life. The only reason the area we are visiting next, the Kinabatangan River, is such a hot spot for wildlife enthusiasts and birders, is because the river and the small protected forest that borders it is all the forest that is left in the area.</p>
<p>Apparently actions are being taken to protect the area and land is being bought back slowly, so we hope for the best. This area was really nice, and, true to it&#39;s reputation, packed with wildlife.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Photo-20160523170937610.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Photo-20160523170937610.jpg" id="blogsy-1464048604514.7363" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="270" height="480"></a></div>
<p>We arrived to our accommodation in the afternoon and after seeing our awesome dorm, we went for tea and immediately found a Yellow Ringed Cat Snake. It was a little juvenile and wound its way around a flute hung for decoration. After this and a donut, we left for the first river cruise. On the first cruise we saw two hornbill species, proboscis monkeys, long tail makaks, silver leaf langers, king fishers, snake eaters, egrets, herons, and crocodiles. The amount of wildlife we saw was unreal and it was made infinitely better by the local guide who was spotting and IDing everything in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>Dinner was delicious that night, especially since it was the first times we had beef in a few weeks.  Later, geckos rained down from the sky.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Photo-20160523170937813.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Photo-20160523170937813.jpg" id="blogsy-1464048604560.6533" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="281"></a></div>

<p>The next morning started early and was full of crocodile spotting. Apparently no one with half a brain swims in this water because these crocs are big and probably hungry.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Photo-20160523170937928.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://quarterlifeexcursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Photo-20160523170937928.jpg" id="blogsy-1464048604547.5515" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="281"></a></div>
<p>Next, we enjoyed breakfast and a day trek through the limited forest. We spotted stick bugs and fresh water otters and tracks, scat, and sounds for many local mammals. We even heard a wild elephant. The guide was so nervous he started beating on the roots of every tree we passed, so we never spotted him. At the lake at the end of the hike, we were warned not to swim in the water. Besides crocodiles, the area was packed with the little feeder fish that are normally seen cleaning tourist feet on the side of the road in Bangkok. Normally a fun and ticklish activity, this lake had so many that it was kind of a hazard. Ha. Imagine being slowly nibbled to death.</p>

<p>The new guide for the day was kind of a bore, but at the end of the second afternoon boat ride, we spoted a wild Orangutan! She was a huge silhouette in the distance, watching us as the sun set from the top of the canopy. After seeing her, I completely understand why the big foot myths exist, and why &#39;orangutan&#39; means &#39;man of the forest&#39;.</p>

<p>The next morning revealed a few more hornbills, monkeys, and crocodiles. After that, we were of to Semporna and Mabul to dive with ScubaJunkie for the next three days. So stoked!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. I wish I had a SLR to take proper photos during this last leg of the trip, but my phone pictures will find their way to Dropbox eventually.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
